<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Microl Wind Power Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Horizontal Axis Wind Turbine</li><li>Vertical Axis Wind Turbine</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The micro wind power market primarily consists of two types of wind turbines: horizontal axis wind turbines (HAWT) and vertical axis wind turbines (VAWT). HAWTs, characterized by their rotor orientation parallel to the wind flow, are more efficient and commonly used in larger installations. In contrast, VAWTs have blades that rotate around a vertical axis, making them suitable for urban environments due to their compact design and ability to capture wind from any direction. Both types serve residential and small-scale energy needs.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Soil Moisture Meter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pin Type</li><li>Catheter Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The soil moisture meter market includes two primary types: pin type and catheter type. Pin type meters utilize metallic probes that penetrate the soil to measure moisture via electrical resistance; they are simple and cost-effective but can potentially harm soil structure. In contrast, catheter type meters employ a more sophisticated system, using a porous tube to extract soil water, providing more accurate readings without disrupting the soil. Both types are essential in agriculture, gardening, and environmental monitoring.</p></p>

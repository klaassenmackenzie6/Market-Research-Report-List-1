<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Magnetic Resonance Imaging Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Closed MRI Systems</li><li>Open MRI Systems</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a medical imaging technique that uses magnetic fields and radio waves to create detailed images of the body. The MRI market is segmented into Closed MRI Systems and Open MRI Systems. Closed MRI systems feature a cylindrical design, offering high-resolution images but limited space, which can cause discomfort for claustrophobic patients. Open MRI systems have a more open design, providing greater patient comfort and accessibility, especially for larger individuals, though they may offer slightly lower image quality compared to closed systems.</p></p>

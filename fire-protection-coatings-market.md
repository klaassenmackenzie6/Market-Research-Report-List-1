<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fire Protection Coatings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cementitious Coatings</li><li>Intumescent Coatings</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The fire protection coatings market primarily includes cementitious and intumescent coatings. Cementitious coatings are made from inorganic materials, providing robust fire resistance and often used for structural elements. These coatings form a protective layer that can withstand high temperatures. In contrast, intumescent coatings consist of organic materials that expand when exposed to heat, creating an insulating barrier. This lightweight option is favored for its aesthetic versatility and effectiveness in preventing structural damage during a fire, making both types essential for fire safety applications.</p></p>

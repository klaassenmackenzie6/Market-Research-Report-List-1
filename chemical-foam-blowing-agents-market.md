<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Chemical Foam Blowing Agents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Endothermic</li><li>Exothermic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Chemical foam blowing agents are categorized into two main types: endothermic and exothermic agents. Endothermic agents absorb heat during the foaming process, leading to a cooling effect and generating gas through the decomposition of substances like ammonium bicarbonate. In contrast, exothermic agents release heat, promoting gas formation through chemical reactions, such as with azodicarbonamide. Both types are essential in various applications, including insulation materials and packaging, influencing properties like density, thermal resistance, and fire retardance in foamed products.</p></p>
